## Getting Started

Install this starter (assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed and updated) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```

Or you can fork the project, make your changes there and merge new features when needed.

Alternatively:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hakooi/gatsby-compact-template YourProjectName # Clone the project
cd YourProjectname
rm -rf .git # So you can have your own changes stored in VCS.
npm install # or yarn install
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```

Edit the export object in `data/SiteConfig`:

```js
module.exports = {
  siteTitle: 'Gatsby Advanced Starter', // Site title.
  siteTitleShort: 'GA Starter', // Short site title for homescreen (PWA). Preferably should be under 12 characters to prevent truncation.
  siteTitleAlt: 'GatsbyJS Advanced Starter', // Alternative site title for SEO.
  siteLogo: '/logos/logo-1024.png', // Logo used for SEO and manifest.
  siteUrl: 'http://compact-hakooi.netlify.app/', // Domain of your website without pathPrefix.
  pathPrefix: '/', // Prefixes all links. For cases when deployed to example.github.io/gatsby-advanced-starter/.

If want to customize Netlify CMS, e.g. registering custom widgets or styling the preview pane, you can do so by editing `src/netlifycms/index.js`:

```js
import CMS from 'netlify-cms-app'

CMS.init({
  config: {
    backend: {
      name: 'git-gateway',
    },
  },
})
```

You can also optionally set `pathPrefix`:

```js
module.exports = {
  // Note: it must *not* have a trailing slash.
  pathPrefix: '/gatsby-advanced-starter', // Prefixes all links. For cases when deployed to example.github.io/gatsby-advanced-starter/.
}
```

WARNING: Make sure to edit `static/robots.txt` to include your domain for the sitemap!

## Pagination

By default the starter will show 4 posts per page. The landing page is the first page located on `/` (controlled by the `Listing` component).

You can control the amount of posts via `SiteConfig` by setting the `postsPerPage: ${NUMBER}`.

NOTE: You can also disable the pagination by setting the `postsPerPage: 0`. In this case the landing page will be controlled by the `Landing` component.

## NetlifyCMS

First of all, make sure to edit `static/admin/config.yml` and add your [GitHub/GitLab/NetlifyId credentials](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/authentication-backends/):

```yml
backend:
  name: github # Refer to https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/authentication-backends/ for auth backend list and instructions
  branch: master # Branch to update
  repo: vagr9k/gatsby-material-starter # Repo for pushing new commits. Make sure to replace with your repo!
```

You can visit `/admin/` after and will be greeted by a login dialog (depending on the auth provider you ave chosen above).

For NetlifyCMS specific issues visit the [official documentation](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/).
